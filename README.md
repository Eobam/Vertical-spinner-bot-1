# Vertical-spinner-bot-1

This is my 3rd bot, and first spinner.

## Main Parts of the bot

For this bot, I'm using beetleweight motors, because although they're heavier and more expensive, they're much more protective and longer lasting than their ant-weight counterparts.

For the weapon, I'm buying a Repeat Robotics pre-made one, because it's just more reliable than whatever I'd end up making

For the connecting parts of the wall + roof, I made these interesting 3 side mounts that should connect each one. For the wall and bottom, I'm just putting screw holes on the wall holes.

For the weapon mount, I'm directly connecting it with a hub, then I have a dead shaft behind the weapon to keep it up during impact.

For the wheels, I'm using big foam ones that I'll 3D print the hubs for.

## Plans

I want to run this at a big event like NHRL, but I think I'll start out with freestyle there, GSCRL, or I'll bring it, and my fairyweigh to 2026 Motorama

I obviously would like to iterate on it after the first event, so we'll see where that goes.
