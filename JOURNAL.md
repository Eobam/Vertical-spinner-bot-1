## 10/2/2025 - Made Basic BOM and did research.  

I've never made a spinner bot before, so all the information was a bit overwhelming at first. After a bit, I found this guide: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IxulfzmkxP2UOKo1TPsEDITqoBg-wLu-mH5bXBPuA1U/edit?tab=t.0) along with Just 'Cuz Robotics guides, I figured out what I needed and was very surprised with how much more stuff I needed than I thought. After some more research on parts, I made a very basic BOM and put some dimensions of parts into a CAD file.
